      <h2>Biography</h2>
      <p> I was born in Springfield Ill. but quickly moved to Hawaii where I grow up watching surfers from my back yard. My dad was in the military so we were pretty taken care of. By the time I got around to high school my parents had relocated us more than 6 different times, ending all the way in Okinawa Japan. I joined the military from there and began to travel the world myself. Glad to have finally settled in the PNW. </p>

      <h2>Education</h2>
      <p> I have studied Air traffic control and Logistical opperations in the military. Boring right. I'm stoked those days are behind me. After the military I got into visual communication at the Bangkok International University. It was there I learned all the skill for my current job, graphic design.

      </p>

      <h2>Job experience</h2>
      <p>In the military I started out as a Air traffic controller, and end my military carrer as a Logistical Opperator. When I got out in 2008 I went to school for visual design while I bartended on the side. In 2015 i started my life as a visual designer. Ive been doing that ever since.</p>

      <h2>Goals</h2>
      <p>My Goal is to be able to use my visual skill to impact the mobile app development world. I want to create apps that help people save time throughout there day as well as help them develope positive life habits.</p>
